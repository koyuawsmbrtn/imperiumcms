# Imperium CMS

A project by koyu.space

## Run it on your own machine

1. Install NodeJS
2. Install Python 3 alongside PIP3

run the following commands to install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app on your machine with the `./run.sh`. It will assign all environment variables needed to run the app and compile the frontend. After all that it begins to serve the frontend (UI, Imperium-FE) and backend (API, ImperiumAPI).

## This looks like garbage and I can't do anything

Remember, that this is an insanely new alpha-release of the app. It will be much better later if everything is completed.
