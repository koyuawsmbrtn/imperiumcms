This is the initial release of ImperiumCMS. Everything should work now as expected. It may contain some bugs here and there, but I can't think of any right now.
Known issues currently include a weak password hashing algorithm so this issue needs to be fixed. I'm also going to write a `docker-compose.yml` for the next release.
I'm glad that I can finally push this out of an alpha state.
